# 🛠️ Apache Tomcat (Educational Clone)

This project is a **simplified educational clone of Apache Tomcat**, built entirely in plain Java without using frameworks like Spring or Jakarta EE.

Its main purpose is to help developers **deeply understand how servlet containers work** under the hood — including HTTP request handling, socket programming, servlet lifecycle, dispatcher mechanisms, and basic routing.

> This is *not* the official Apache Tomcat project. This is a self-built educational experiment inspired by Tomcat’s architecture and behavior.

## 📚 Purpose

Most backend developers use Spring Boot or similar frameworks every day — but **very few understand what happens beneath the surface**.

This project was built to:

- Simulate the lifecycle of an HTTP server and servlet engine
- Handle raw socket connections and manual threading
- Parse HTTP requests and return proper HTTP responses
- Route requests to the correct servlet/controller (like `DispatcherServlet`)
- Practice I/O, concurrency, and protocol basics
- Learn how frameworks like Tomcat, Spring, or Jetty are built internally

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Built with **pure Java (no frameworks)**
- Basic HTTP request parsing
- Simple routing & dispatcher system
- Servlet-like lifecycle and response system
- Educational comments in code

## 🚫 Not for Production Use

This server is built **only for learning purposes**. It is not secure, optimized, or production-ready. Use it to study, tweak, and build your understanding of:

- HTTP servers
- Servlet containers
- Network programming
- Java I/O and multithreading

But please **do not reuse this project as a commercial web server.**

## 💡 Inspiration

Created by a Java developer seeking to go deeper into how web infrastructure works — not just use frameworks, but understand and reimplement them from scratch.

If you're learning or mentoring, this project might be a great hands-on supplement.

**Happy hacking!**
